# Plotting Sounds on Graphs

## About

A Python program to plot the audio of a sound onto a wave/time graph.

## Requirements

In order to use the program, you need to have the Matplotlib module installed. To do this, simply run `pip install matplotlib`.

## Implementation

To run the code, you need to pass the path of the audio file in the command line. To do this, type `python soundwave.py sample_audio.wav` in a terminal. 

NOTE: The name of the Python file is `soundwave.py` and the name of the audio file is `sample_audio.wav`. These need to be changed according to your system.
